.. zephyr:board:: n900

Overview
********

The Nokia N900 (RX-51) is a 2009 smartphone built around the TI OMAP3430 SoC: a single ARM
Cortex-A8 core, 256 MB of SDRAM and an 800x480 LCD.

Zephyr runs from SDRAM after the phone's bootloader, NOLO, has initialized the SoC, the memory
and the display. The image is loaded into RAM over USB; nothing is written to flash.

Hardware
********

Supported Features
==================

.. zephyr:board-supported-hw::

Console
=======

The console is drawn on the LCD: the SoC takes over the graphics layer that NOLO configured and
renders ``printk()`` and standard output with the character framebuffer fonts
(:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_SOC_OMAP3_DSS_CONSOLE`).

UART3 is available on test pads under the battery at 1.8 V and is described in the devicetree,
but it is not the default console.

Display
=======

NOLO configures the panel and the display controller. The display driver
(:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_TI_OMAP3_DISPC`) points the graphics layer at a 2 MB framebuffer reserved
at the top of SDRAM and provides the 800x480 screen in XRGB8888 to the display API and LVGL.
The console uses the same framebuffer and is not available while the display driver is enabled.
The display driver forwards brightness changes to the panel controller on McSPI1
(:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_ACX565AKM`).

LEDs
====

The LP5523 LED driver on I2C2 (:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_LP5523`) drives the keyboard backlight on
LEDs 0 to 3, 7 and 8 and the status LED on LEDs 4 (blue), 5 (green) and 6 (red). The camera flash
is an ADP1653 on I2C2 (:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_ADP1653`), with the torch limited to 50 mA.

Keyboard and power button
=========================

The TWL5030 power management chip on I2C1 scans the keyboard matrix and watches the power button
and USB VBUS, signalling changes on its interrupt line, which the TWL4030 MFD driver
(:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_MFD_TWL4030`) dispatches. With :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_INPUT` enabled, the
keypad driver reports the keys of the keymap in the board devicetree and the power button driver
reports ``INPUT_KEY_POWER``. Applications can register for USB VBUS changes with
``mfd_twl4030_add_irq_callback()``.

The lock switch and the camera key are GPIO keys reporting ``INPUT_KEY_COFFEE``,
``INPUT_KEY_CAMERA_FOCUS`` and ``INPUT_KEY_CAMERA``. The keypad slide, the front proximity sensor,
the camera lens cover and the back cover report switch events (``INPUT_EV_SW``). The TSC2005 touchscreen on McSPI1
(:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_INPUT_TSC2005`) reports touches in display coordinates.

Sensors
=======

The TSL2563 ambient light sensor on I2C2 behind the front glass is supported by the TSL2561 driver
(:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_TSL2561`). The glass attenuates the light, so the reported illuminance is
lower than the ambient light. The LIS302DL accelerometer on I2C3
(:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_LIS302DL`) reports acceleration in the axes of the chip, data ready on its
INT1 line and single taps on its INT2 line.

USB
===

The high-speed USB OTG controller with its ISP1707 PHY works as a USB device controller
(:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_UDC_OMAP3_MUSB`) under the label ``zephyr_udc0`` used by the USB device
samples, for example :zephyr:code-sample:`usb-cdc-acm`.

Bluetooth
=========

The Broadcom BCM2048 Bluetooth controller on UART2 speaks Nokia's H4+, which the
:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_NOKIA_H4P` driver implements: H4 with frames padded to an even length,
negotiation and alive packets before any HCI traffic, and wakeup lines in both directions for the
controller's sleep mode. The BCM2048 is a Bluetooth 2.1 + EDR controller without LE, so it needs a
Host that supports controllers without LE.

Until Nokia's firmware script has been sent to it, the controller's ROM answers the H4+ setup and
HCI_Reset but no other command. The script is ``/lib/firmware/bcmfw.bin`` of Maemo's
``bt-firmware`` package. Nokia's license allows neither modifying it nor distributing it for
commercial purposes without their approval, so it is not part of this repository: set
:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_NOKIA_H4P_FIRMWARE` to the path of a copy to build it in. The link runs
at 120000 baud, the controller's speed out of reset, as faster speeds need the UART's 13x mode.

Any of these gives the script, 9560 bytes with the MD5 sum ``37db4bcf79fa7a85f1331c6df19115b9``:

- The source of the Mer ``bcm-bt-firmware`` package on the Sailfish OS build service. Despite its
  name, the archive is not compressed:

  .. code-block:: console

     curl -LO https://build.sailfishos.org/public/source/nemo:devel:hw:ti:omap3:n900/bcm-bt-firmware/bcm-bt-firmware-0.21rc3.tar.bz2
     tar -xf bcm-bt-firmware-0.21rc3.tar.bz2
     FW=$PWD/bcm-bt-firmware-0.21rc3/BCM2048B0_002.001.011.0190.0192.c.bin
     west build -b n900 <app> -- -DCONFIG_BT_NOKIA_H4P_FIRMWARE=\"$FW\"

- ``/lib/firmware/bcmfw.bin`` on a phone running Maemo.
- A Maemo firmware image for the N900, such as
  ``RX-51_2009SE_20.2010.36-2_PR_COMBINED_MR0_ARM.bin``: ``0xFFFF -M <image> -u <dir>`` unpacks its
  root file system image, from which ``ubireader_extract_files`` of the ``ubi_reader`` Python
  package extracts ``lib/firmware/bcmfw.bin``.

The script gives the controller the placeholder address ``11:11:11:11:11:11``; a public identity
created with :c:func:`bt_id_create` before :c:func:`bt_enable` replaces it. The controller does not
support the HCI Read Encryption Key Size command, so the Host has to accept encrypted BR/EDR links
with an unknown key size.

With the console on USB (the ``cdc-acm-console`` snippet), enable
:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_USBD_CDC_ACM_WORKQUEUE`: the Host initializes on the system workqueue,
which otherwise also drains the console, and logging during the initialization then blocks it.

Wi-Fi
=====

The TI WL1251 802.11b/g controller on McSPI4 has the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_WIFI_WL1251` driver.
The chip has no firmware of its own: bringing the network interface up powers it and loads the
firmware and the calibration data (NVS) into it, which takes about 1.6 seconds, and taking the
interface down powers it off. The interface does not come up by itself.

The two files are ``ti-connectivity/wl1251-fw.bin`` and ``ti-connectivity/wl1251-nvs.bin`` of
`linux-firmware`_, where TI's ``LICENCE.ti-connectivity`` applies to them; Maemo has the same files
in ``/lib/firmware``. They are not part of this repository: set
:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_WIFI_WL1251_FIRMWARE` and :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_WIFI_WL1251_NVS` to the
paths of copies to build them in.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - ``wl1251-nvs.bin``
     - 752
     - ``6d570e73a9cb1f686b2ad5cdbbdf6b83``

The driver scans on its own. Joining a network takes wpa_supplicant
(:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_WIFI_NM_WPA_SUPPLICANT`), which authenticates and associates through the
driver and sets the keys of its handshake in the chip; the chip encrypts and decrypts. WPA2 with
CCMP is supported; WEP, TKIP, WPA3 and protected management frames are not. Open networks take
the same path without keys, but have not been tried.
``apps/bringup/wifi`` has the network and Wi-Fi shells and, in ``overlay-supplicant.conf``, the
configuration that wpa_supplicant needs:

.. code-block:: console

   west build -b n900 -S cdc-acm-console zephyr-n900/apps/bringup/wifi -- \
     -DEXTRA_CONF_FILE=overlay-supplicant.conf \
     -DCONFIG_WIFI_WL1251_FIRMWARE=\"$FW/wl1251-fw.bin\" \
     -DCONFIG_WIFI_WL1251_NVS=\"$FW/wl1251-nvs.bin\"

.. code-block:: console

   uart:~$ net iface up 1
   uart:~$ wifi scan
   uart:~$ wifi connect -s <SSID> -k 1 -p <passphrase>
   uart:~$ net ping 192.168.1.1

The NVS file has default calibration values and a placeholder MAC address. The calibration of the
individual phone is in its CAL flash partition, which Zephyr does not read. The MAC address comes
from the ``local-mac-address`` property of the devicetree node if it has one, and is otherwise
derived from the OMAP die ID and marked as locally administered.

The chip stays awake while the interface is up: the driver uses none of the chip's power save
modes. The firmware's coexistence with the Bluetooth controller, which shares the antenna, is
enabled with TI's default parameters and has not been tried with Bluetooth in use. Frames pass
between the driver and the chip at about 1 Mbit/s, the pace of the SPI controller driver's polled
transfers.

Random numbers
==============

The N900 is a high-security OMAP3 device, where only the secure world has access to the hardware
random number generator. The entropy driver (:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_ENTROPY_OMAP3_ROM`) gets
random numbers from a service of the secure ROM code instead, as Linux does, and is the board's
``zephyr,entropy`` device: with :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_ENTROPY_GENERATOR` enabled, the random
number APIs and PSA Crypto use it, and no application needs
:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_TEST_RANDOM_GENERATOR`. A call into the secure world returns four bytes and
takes about 15 microseconds, with interrupts locked.

Charging
========

The bq24150A charger on I2C2 is enabled by default
(:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_CHARGER_BQ2415X`) and charges the battery from USB with the settings in the
board devicetree: 4.2 V, 650 mA, with a 500 mA input current limit. The bq27200 fuel gauge reports
the battery voltage, current, temperature and charge level.

The charger has no temperature input on the N900, so the board reads the battery temperature from
the fuel gauge every 10 seconds and charges only between
:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BOARD_N900_CHARGE_TEMP_MIN` and
:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BOARD_N900_CHARGE_TEMP_MAX` (0 to 45 degrees Celsius by default).

While the charger is active, the phone runs from USB with the battery removed;
``sys_reboot()`` restarts it into NOLO.

Programming and Debugging
*************************

The ``nolo`` runner loads images with `0xFFFF`_, the open source Maemo flasher, which asks NOLO
to load an image into RAM and start it. The image starts with a position-independent stub that
moves it to its link address, so the address NOLO loads it to does not matter.

Zephyr stops the MPU and IVA2 watchdogs of the OMAP3 that NOLO leaves running, and the watchdog
of the power management chip. Put the phone in R&D mode once with:

.. code-block:: console

   0xFFFF -R 1 -F no-omap-wd,no-ext-wd,no-lifeguard-reset

``0xFFFF -R 0`` restores the default.

Building and Running
====================

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :host-os: unix
   :board: n900
   :goals: build flash

``west flash`` waits for the phone. Power it on with USB connected; hold :kbd:`u` if it boots its
installed system instead of entering NOLO's USB mode.

The application output appears on the LCD:

.. code-block:: text

   *** Booting Zephyr OS vx.x.x-xxx-gxxxxxxxxxxxx ***
   Hello World! n900/omap3430

Holding the power button for two seconds restarts the phone into NOLO, ready for the next
``west flash`` (:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BOARD_N900_POWER_KEY_REBOOT`). Pulling the battery returns
the phone to its installed system.

Debugging boot failures
=======================

:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_SOC_OMAP3_BOOT_STAGES` paints a colored band into NOLO's framebuffer at
each boot stage before the MMU is enabled, and a solid screen color once it is, which locates
early failures without a serial port.
